# CMathParser
A fairly robust mathematics parsing engine for C++ projects which supports all standard mathematical operations for integer, decimal (floating point), logic and bitwise. Other features include ability for the engine to show its work and the support for custom functions and variables using method callbacks. Lots of example included in: [Entry.cpp](https://github.com/NTDLS/CMathParser/blob/master/%40TestApp/Entry.Cpp)

It addition to the custom functions and variables, thse are built in: ACOS, ASIN, ATAN, ATAN2, LDEXP, SINH, COSH, TANH, LOG, LOG10, EXP, MODPOW, SQRT, POW, FLOOR, CEIL, NOT, AVG, SUM, TAN, ATAN, SIN, COS, ABS.

If you came for the C# version you can find it at: [NTDLS.ExpressionParser](https://github.com/NTDLS/NTDLS.ExpressionParser/)
